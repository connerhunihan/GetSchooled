# Info206_GroupI
Repo for Group I's final project in Info 206

Our goal is to improve the search process for prospective college students. While there is plenty of information out there, it can be overwhelming for applicants to sift through and find the most relevant data. By aggregating this data, conducting analysis, and presenting it in a digestible way, we hope to ease the burden of searching for colleges.

*Included with the code you should do a ~one page write up of what you completed, any you challenges you faced, as well as how we should go about testing and using your project code. This information can be included in the README file of the Github repository or as a separate document contained within the repository.*
