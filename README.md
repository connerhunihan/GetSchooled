# Info206_GroupI
Repo for Group I's final project in Info 206

For our project, we plan to explore traffic data in the Bay Area. We want to build a program that helps users gain a sense for where accidents tend to occur, by factoring in conditionals (time of year, location, etc). We hope to provide a tool where users can input their end destination and gain insights on the optimal route.
